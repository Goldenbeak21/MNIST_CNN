# MNIST_CNN

The aim is to develop a convolutional neural network based model to identify the digit(0-9) given a grey scale image.

The data files train.csv and test.csv contain gray-scale images of hand-drawn digits, from zero through nine. Each image is 28 pixels in height and 28 pixels in width, for a total of 784 pixels in total. Each pixel has a single pixel-value associated with it, indicating the lightness or darkness of that pixel, with higher numbers meaning darker. This pixel-value is an integer between 0 and 255, inclusive.

The data has been taken from Kaggle.[https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data]
